## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
In the current project, the capability of pre-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) by ImageNet features is 
proposed for categorization of brain tumors by utilizing mammogram images. The pre-trained models like ResNet50, InceptionV3, 
Xception, DenseNet121, MobileNetV3Large, EfcientNetB0, EfcientNetV2L, EfcientNetV2B0 have been exploited for 
classifcation purpose.
